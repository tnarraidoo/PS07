# Collaboration

Please indicate who you collaborated with on this assignment: 



# Build binary classifier

Build the binary classifier based on a single predictor variable: `DebtRatio`,
`age`, or `MonthlyIncome`. Justify this choice.

```{r}

```



# ROC curve

Based on the ultimate classifier you choose, plot a corresponding ROC curve.

```{r}

```



# ROC curve for random guessing

Instead of using any predictor information as you did above, switch your
predictions to random guesses and plot the resulting ROC curve.

```{r}

```
